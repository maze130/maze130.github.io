        DBC has been an intersting experience from the get go. My first expectation from the program was that I am going to learn a lot of material and at a rapid pace. I knew from applying that this program was going to be different than anything I have experienced thus far. Just learning to code is not the entire cirriculum. Learning about yourself is something I have taken away from the first few days within the program. Discovering how you learn, how you think and to notice the environment around you. I myself am a complete beginner in this industry. Just learning more about myself and the beginning workings of code have been a wonderful challenge. I am very excited to continue learning and see what this program has to offer. Also knowing that I am paired with people that have a similar motivation and interest in this material make the experience all the more special. Expecting one thing can only help you get so far. Taking every opportunity thrown my way and adapting to what these great people have put together in this program is exactly the mindset that will help me succeed. Nerves of course play a role when charting on a journey that is completely new. Support throughout the DBC community is a big factor for success. I am just thankful for being on this journey with many others alike.
