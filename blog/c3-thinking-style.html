      I have just completed week 3 of DBC. What an awesome feeling this experience has been so far. Between learning many web development concepts and working with like minded individuals, I know I made the right choice for a new future path. Some concepts were easier to learn than others such as html and simple beginner programming in ruby. While css and intermediate programs being slighty more challenging to overcome. DBC first introduced me to my "thinking style". I had never considered there being a name or term for different mind sets. Oddly enough I scored equally in different categories. Them being:concrete sequential, abstract sequential, and only slightly lower in abstract random. By knowing this sort of information is helpful to mold my learning experience here at DBC. I always enjoy using logic and order in my reasoning and thought process. That style gives me something to go off of when preparing the concepts that I need to learn for the week. I have enjoyed the process this program gives its students to learn so far. The different types of challenges and exercises really gets my thinking going to complete everything as efficient as possible. I have never learned and practiced this amount of material in a group setting. It is throughougly enjoyable to meet different people to overcome coding exercises together. Having a tight knit community within the program really brings out the best in others it seems. Being able to communicate and rely on others going through the same experience as me truly brings all of this together. I am excited to continue on this path and expand my knowledge of this industry. Growing my mind and adapting to challenges thrown at me keeps me on my toes. Never again will I be keeping my brain on a fixed path. DBC has taught so much in such a small time that it seems like anything is possible.
