      The tech industry is a wonderful place to be starting a career these days. It is seeing a massive amount of growth in both open positions and practical daily usage. Between new computer applications to mobile applications and moving different concepts to vehicles these days is a wonderful thing. As time passes more and more jobs will become automated. This should help increase production and be more cost efficient. With everything moving to an online tech state, all of this data will need to be protected. This brings me to an issue that is being addressed by numerous companies and the government. That is cybersecurity. Having all data online and easily accessible most certainly has its advantages. But of course there are people who always try and take advantage of the system. Whether that be stealing a person's identity or taking their bank information to purchase goods. No one wants their personal data stolen. This also stems to companies. Whether they are holding upcoming product details or people's information, this is something that does not want to be available to the general public. With cars incorporating more technology and being run by computer base that could pose an issue. Imagine driving your vehicle on the highway and somebody from a different state is able to disable your braking system. This can cause some serious issues. New companies will need to spring up and provide this much needed cybersecurity globally to businesses and consumers. This will be a major forthcoming that will addressed soon. It will surely open many jobs for people to help develop intricate systems. This does not take away that the tech industry will be moving forward in a bright and speedy future.
