      When seeing the cirriculum for the first time and knowing that I would be pairing with people at least twice per week had me a little nervous. Being completely new in this industry I had no prior knowledge to any of the taught concepts. Being that I have never met anyone in the cohorts I did not know if they had practice with these challenges before. This put a little fear in me not knowing if I would be able to keep up with some of the other students during our pairing sessions. The first time pairing actually went very smooth. Both myself and my partner were able to communicate efficiently and complete the task at hand. Any bumps in the road that we may have hit were discussed through and eliminated. I throughouly enjoyed working as a pair which surprised me. It is nice having another mind look at the problem in front of you and give input that you may not be thinking. Ever since then I have looked forward to my pairing sessions because I get to meet new people and really see how well the program is working for others besides myself. Reading through the feedback that others have said about me put a smile on my face. Thinking that I am working well with others and actually doing it are different things. It was very nice to hear that pairs are willing to do a challenge again together in the future. Also hearing that I had a pretty solid grasp of the material boosts my confidence in tackling further challenges alone or with someone else. Overall I couldn't be happier that the program has us pairing with other students on different challenges and talk through all the coding steps. It always brightens my day to complete something newly learned with someone else and have our thoughts process something.
