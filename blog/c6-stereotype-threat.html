      Stereotype threat is an interesting topic. Some people might feel the downward pressure of it on a daily basis while others may never have it see the light of day. Being put into a category because of certain aspect of a person is not a good feeling. No one deserves to be pre judged no matter what the situation may be. Expected to do well or poor academically based on your race of gender can actually have the opposite effect of what is thought to be true. I do not believe I have felt stereotype threat personally. I have of course felt pressured to do well in school just because it is the right thing to do or to behave in a certain way because of the social event that we were attending. But I do feel as if those are normalcies that can be expected at those points in time. I could only imagine what someone would feel if every day they might be letting someone down which in turn lowers their self esteem. That would be quite awful to feel. Personally I would not want someone to feel unwanted pressure due to absurd circumstances. I was told to always treat people as equals and with the upmost respect. By doing so, anyone that I surround myself with should feel comfortable and at home with whatever situation may face us. Being able to achieve things that someone sets out to do is the greatest accomplishment someone can hold themselves to. Not being able to face some of those because of a stereotype is an unacceptable way to bring down that person as a human being.
