      In general I try and live up to some of these values:
      Confidence
      Friendships
      Committment
      Efficiency
      Now efficiency and order kind of tie in for me. I like being prepared and planning to get prepared. It's important to know what steps to take ahead so someone is efficient. Being efficient wastes no ones time and makes sure something is done properly. Having things being done in order help this in general.
      In the last couple of weeks I definitely asked for advice on a few personal topics for myself. This is where friendships truly are valued. The connection over time that is built through friendship is something that is grown from a small seed(meeting the person) and shared for both people. It was really put into perspective on how to handle certain situations and what kind of advice someone is able to give knowing them for long enough. I believe everyone's values somehow defines who they are and how they act. Whether that be in a good or bad manner. Also values do seem to change over time. No one is stuck in a cement path yet there are core feelings that help guide and mold a person over time.
