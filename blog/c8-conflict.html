      Conflict is something that everyone has experienced. Sometimes they are small annoyances but sometimes they can be big life changing issues. It is not something everyone wants to deal with but has not choice. A small conflict I have had was implementing a new sales process at my workplace. Our sales at the club were not hitting the best numbers and it was time for a change. We needed a new direction to increase the member count up. Since each member of the team had to sell in a similar way it was not easy to think of a new process and get everyone on board. It was easy for them to do the same daily routine and not have something mess with their flow. Sitting down one on one with each member and explaining the situation was the first step to moving forward. Some people produced resistance. This is not an easy task since we have to stand as a united front of the club. Having a well thought out plan was nice to have. After the one on ones we had a group meeting to discuss what should be going on. Over the meeting everything went smooth and the plan was tweaked to accommodate small things. The new process was implemented in small batches which helped with the learning curve for all the team members. I learned a lot about managing and working with others during this entire conflict.
