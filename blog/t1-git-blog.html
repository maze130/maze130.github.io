        The first question to ask yourself is, What is version control? Version control is a collection of files for any project that are gathered over time. The files are ones that have been changed to update the project that is being worked on. The version control allows a user to swap to an earlier version of a project in case there is an error with the code or if the path that was chosen needed a change. This system also allows multiple users to access the project and make changes as they see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is a type of version control. Any changes to a project are only made locally on one's computer. Git keeps track of all changes with dates that are made. Once a change is made it needs to be added to the log. $Git add <file> allows anything changed to be stored in the log. Once you are ready to seal the changes to the current version one has to commit anything they changed. $Git commit <file> will do this. Using a proper commit message helps with sorting and viewing what changes were made at a certain time. All projects are then able to be stored online and accessed anywhere. An example of this site would be Github. After committing changes you would need to update the remote version of the project with a $Git push. This command sends any local changes made to the remote master copy of the project. Team members are able to review all changes made, and then decide which to merge into the master copy.
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned earlier Github is a site in which developers/programmers are able to share their code and projects. A benefit to Github is that a user can put a license on a project to protect permissions a person would have in using and distributing their code. It would be important to decide which type of license to use depending on the project one is working on. This certainly protects the original creator in any case. Having your code posted on an open source site really allows for different points of view and opinions to be added your code. Any issues a developer may have can be seen and helped on by any amount of people. Posting your code on an open source site really allows for project growth and great collaboration globally between anyone looking to make a change.
