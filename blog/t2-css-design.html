      When adding an element in HTML there are many aspects that effect the look and style of that particular piece. You can consider each elemnt a box of code. In the middle there is the content. Just outside is called the padding. Around the padding is considered the border. And surrounding the border is the margin.

      Now to delve deeper into what each of those parts of the HTML element mean. The content is what the user types into his computer that they would like to display on the screen for everyone to see. This could be anything from an image to a link to some description they have of an object. This content is what the user will want to manipulate around the design of their web page or application. Now comes the padding. Padding is the distance your content is from the border. This may mean you wanna display some writing in the center of a block of content away from a specific border that you are displaying. The border is outline of the content. Sometimes it is visible and other times it is not. This all depends on the design of the user. An example could be a dotted red line along the edges of a picture. The user may display their border how they please within their web application. It is also on an object to object basis. Lastly you have the margin in which everything is "enclosed". The margin effects how far your element is away from other elements. A user can adjust the settings for a top,bottom,left or right margin. Each adjustment to one of those makes the element display differently for the viewer. This helps place objects where a user may want them to end up in their overall design. There are many different ways to manipulate an element. This is just a glimpse of what someone can do to customize their overall goal for a project.
