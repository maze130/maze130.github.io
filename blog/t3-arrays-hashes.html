      A very basic description of arrays and hashes is they are both collections of stored data that can be used and accessed during a program. Now of course that gets the point across for a simple understanding but we shall dive a bit further to distinguish the differences between the two. Arrays are an ordered list of objects. They start at a value of 0 and go up from their. The placement number for each object corresponds to the order it was entered into the array. An example of an array would be the days of the week. days_of_the_week = ["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"]. This is how a small array of objects would be presented. Monday being the first object into the array would give it a value of 0. If you wanted to call "Monday" then you would access it like this: days_of_the_week[0]. Hashes are similar to arrays in that they are collections of data but it is pairs of data that are stored. Each object or name would have a value attached to it. An example of how a hash is set up is: cars = {"sporty" => "BMW M4", "suv" => "Nissan Murano", "hybrid" => "Tesla Model S", "van" => "Honda Odyssey"}. Instead of each object having a numerical value in an array, they have a name and value in a hash. cars["sporty"] would display BMW M4. They both have their positive uses but it just depends on what kind of data the user is storing for later use.
