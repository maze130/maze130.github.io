      Every object in ruby is part of a class. The mose generic class is Object since everything is one. "Jason" would be part of the string class. While 47 would be part of the integer class. When defining a method that creates it as a local in the user's system. A benefit of having a program use a class allows methods and variables to be used in different parts of the program without defining each time. Classes allow iterating over data that can resemble more closely to real world objects. Being able to hold different parts of data and sort through objects that have different aspects to them.
