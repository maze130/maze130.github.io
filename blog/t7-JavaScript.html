      Newly this week I was introduced to the programming language Javascript. This is a brand new experience for me since I have been learning Ruby for the past couple of weeks. The first thing I noticed was that there seemed to be a lot more syntax in this language. Syntax is extremely important when programming. One little missed comma could cause your entire program not to function depending where that should be placed. So there being a more of it makes things a little tricky at first to learn. Of course over time writing Javascript becomes more natural the more you use it. Now there are some similarities to the two languages as well. The basic math functions were identical. As well as there being loops and arrays. The loops definitly differ in how they are written but want to accomplish the same outcome. A hash in Ruby is like an object in Javascript. The basic concept is the same but how they are written is slightly different in notation. Both languages seem to have a bunch of built in methods available for the user right off the bat. Overall it does seem like a good language for a beginner to learn on, seeing as most of it is straight forward and not too difficult to grasp.
