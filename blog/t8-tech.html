      Test driven development is a process to get a working program. There are five steps in this process. The first step being, add a test. The user would know the end result that they are looking for. Then create the test so they could focus on the requirements before writing the code. The second step is running the tests. This step makes sure there isn't code already in place that makes this new function work. The third step is to write some of the code. The code written in this step makes sure the new tests the user has made works properly and passes. Just the basic needs to have the test pass. The fourth step is to now run all the new tests. This allows the user to see if the code they had just written is accomplishing what they set out to do. The last step of this process is to refactor the code. Refactoring is to make the code more functional and user friendly. It also allows the person to clean up and make sure the code follows the D.R.Y rule. This entire method is a different way of creating a program. It is very interesting to know what the end result should be and kind of working backwards to get that result.
